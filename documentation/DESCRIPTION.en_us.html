<p>Drafting* Mono aims to capture spirit and logic of typewritten alphabets, rather then mimic the appearance literally. It is a celebration of the production stage of projects, which often use monospaced fonts as a placeholder.</p>

<p>This font family includes a full range of weights, italics, an extended character set, and some OpenType features. It was made with love and will continue to improve with your support. <a href="http://indestructibletype.com/Drafting">Visit the website for more information!</a></p>
