`sfd2ufo` â€” An SFD to UFO converter
===================================

I'm not smart enough to know how to code this stuff in python myself, so this is forked from [aliftype](https://github.com/aliftype).

indestructible type* maintains its [own fork](https://github.com/indestructible-type/sfdLib), which thise code here is pulled from.

I didn't want to make anyone install any additional software, so this just runs locally.
