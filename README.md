About
-----
Monospaced fonts are often used during the production stage of projects. They are used by programmers while coding, and film crews while filming. They resemble the rhythm of typewriters, which are monospaced due to technical limitations, and permeate our predigital visual landscape.

Drafting* Mono aims to capture this "still-in-the-works" spirit, with something neutral and timeless that is also personal and anachronistic. A seemingly self-contradictory desire, it takes heavy inspiration from typewriters, aiming to capture the spirit and logic of typewritten alphabets, rather then mimic the appearance literally.

Building
--------
Build scripts can be found inside the "sources" folder. To build, download and install the required software listed in the "requirements.txt" file and run the build script that corresponds to your desired output (so if you want woff2 files run "build-woff2.sh")

Contributing
---------------
Drafting* Mono is built and maintained using the open-source program [FontForge](https://fontforge.org), and by default will build the finished fonts using the FontForge files as sources. FontForge is free and cross platform, so it is possible for anyone looking to contribute to this project to use it to make modifications to the source files.

If you'd rather work with UFO files, simply run the "build-ufo.sh" shell script, and UFO files will be generated using the FontForge files as sources. If a "ufo" folder is detected in the "sources" folder, the other build scripts will automatically switch to using the UFO files as sources instead of the FontForge files. All the scripts should work without having FontForge installed, so you should be able to contribute using your software of choice.
